# imdb-scraper
A simple script used for scraping Movie titles and rating from IMDB Search Url using Beautiful Soup4.

1. tqdm (if you love progress bars, like me :D)
2. BeautifulSoup4 (I mean, implied, duh)
3. urllib3 (Url parsing, use your favourite)

**I will be candid and say, I am a learning develeper, so any kind of feedaback is appreciated.**
